# Tasks: Fix Spacebar State Sticking

- [x] Verify that using Space + Key (modifier action) correctly suppresses the space character but resets the state for the next press. <!-- id: 1 -->
- [x] Verify that a subsequent tap of Space (without modifier action) correctly outputs a space. <!-- id: 2 -->
- [x] Verify that rapid switching between typing and mirroring does not cause the spacebar to lose its "Space" function. <!-- id: 3 -->
