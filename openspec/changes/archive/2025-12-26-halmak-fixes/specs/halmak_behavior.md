# Halmak Mode Behavior

## CapsLock
- **Caps Lock:** Acts as `Enter`.
- **Space + Caps Lock:** Acts as `'` (Single Quote).

## Spacebar
- **Space (Hold):** Acts as Mirror Modifier.
- **Space (Tap):** Output a single `Space` character immediately on release if no other key was pressed.
    - *Note:* This single-tap behavior applies globally to all modes when Space is used as a modifier.
